Mod for Binding of Isaac:Rebirth focused on thematic approaches to each character. Designed for racing!

This mod's intended use is for racers to compete with the same character. 

Every character outside of Eden has been given a themed build that the player will need to work around to find success.

Most game-altering builds have been moved to the secret room or have been completely removed. 
  For a complete list of the items moved/removed check the ItemChanges.txt file in the source. 
  
The intended gameplay mechanics have been explained in the CharacterBuilds.txt under the build descriptions near the bottom.
  I HIGHLY encourage players to try and "break" the implied gameplay mechanic, let me know what you do when you break things!
  
Install in the resources directory of your isaac folder. 
Before dropping the files, make sure you "packed" folder is the only one remaining!
